# Alien_Walking_Simulator
 Made this to test tilemaps and pixel animations :)

All assets made by me. Feel free to use them for whatever you want!

The movement works on a grid-based system. The player casts a ray to check if there is something blocking their path, and if not - moves by a set amount.
I had some trouble figuring out how to keep this system while still allowing the player to go behind objects, but in the end I managed and I'm happy with how it turned out.
